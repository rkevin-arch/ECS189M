Play around with the system and do the following tasks. Once you're ready, run `answer x` to try to do the xth task.

1: Try backgrounding this process and foregrounding it again.
2: What's my PID?
3: Send me a SIGUSR1 signal.
4: Redirect my standard input to be the contents of /home/user/in.txt
5: Redirect my standard error into /dev/null.
6: Cat out the contents of /home/user/in.txt, grep for the lines that contain the lowercase letter 'a', and pipe the result into me.
7: Run `. spawner` to solve this challenge. I've just spawned 5 background jobs. Find the correct one to foreground!
