  Time for some more advanced topics! SSH into `linuxadv@twinpeaks.cs.ucdavis.edu`. Play around with the system and do the following tasks. Once you're ready, run `answer x` to try to do the xth task.

  1: Try backgrounding this process and foregrounding it again.
  2: What's my PID?
  3: Send me a SIGUSR1 signal.
  4: Redirect my standard input to be the contents of /home/user/in.txt
  5: Redirect my standard error into /dev/null.
  6: Cat out the contents of /home/user/in.txt, grep for the lines that contain the lowercase letter 'a', and pipe the result into me.
  7: Run `. spawner` to solve this challenge. I've just spawned 5 background jobs. Find the correct one to foreground!
