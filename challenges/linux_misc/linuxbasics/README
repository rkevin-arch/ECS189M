Play around with the system and answer the following questions:

1: What's your current working directory?
2: Search the man pages. What command would you use to generate random permutations?
3: On what day was /home/user/myfile.txt modified? Use the date format 2019-12-31
4: How big is /home/user/myfile.txt, in kilobytes? Round to the nearest whole number.
5: What user owns the file /home/user/myfile.txt?
6: What's the 3-digit octal permissions of the file /home/user/myfile.txt? (e.g 777)
7: What is the user id of 'admin'?
8: There's a user 'john' on the system. Can he write to /home/user/myfile.txt?
9: Can the 'admin' user execute /home/user/myfile.txt?
10: Which user on the system, except for you, root, admin and john, can execute /home/user/myfile.txt?
11: /home/user/myfile.txt looks like a txt file, but it actually isn't. What kind of file is it?
12: Change the ownership and permissions of /home/user/chme, so that you have full read-write-execute permissions, jade and rose can read the file only, and john cannot read write or execute the file.
