  You have some big log files, time to get some useful data out of them! SSH into `loganalysis@twinpeaks.cs.ucdavis.edu`. Play around with the system and answer the following questions:

  1: How many lines are in access.log?
  2: Using access.log, which IP tried to find information about Siemens?
  3: Using access.log, how many requests claim to be from a Windows 10 machine?
  4: Using access.log, how many unique IP made requests to the server?
  5: Using access.log, which IP made the most requests to the webserver?
  6: Using auth.log, which IP appeared the most amount of times in the file?
  7: Find the right "flag" in flags.txt. The flag should look like `ECS{START_TAIL}`, where `START` only contains uppercase letters, numbers and underscores. `TAIL` is 32 characters long and only contains numbers and the upper case letters A-F. There should be no characters before or after the flag.

  Once you have figured out the answer to a question, run `answer x` to answer question number x.
flag: ECS{3X4M1N3_3XTR4CT_3XTR4P0L4T3_3A7FB33B1BE13E7AC844524F94C4A6EE}
