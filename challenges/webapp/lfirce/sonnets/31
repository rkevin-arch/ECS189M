<h4>XXXI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Thou comest! all is said without a word.
I sit beneath thy looks, as children do
In the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through
Their happy eyelids from an unaverred
Yet prodigal inward joy.&nbsp; Behold, I erred
In that last doubt! and yet I cannot rue
The sin most, but the occasion&mdash;that we two
Should for a moment stand unministered
By a mutual presence.&nbsp; Ah, keep near and close,
Thou dove-like help! and when my fears would rise,
With thy broad heart serenely interpose:
Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies
These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,
Like callow birds left desert to the skies.</p>
