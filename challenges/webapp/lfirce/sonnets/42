<h4>XLII</h4>
<p class="poetry">My future will not copy fair my past&mdash;

I wrote that once; and thinking at my side
My ministering life-angel justified
The word by his appealing look upcast
To the white throne of God, I turned at last,
And there, instead, saw thee, not unallied
To angels in thy soul!&nbsp; Then I, long tried
By natural ills, received the comfort fast,
While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim&rsquo;s staff
Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled.
I seek no copy now of life&rsquo;s first half:
Leave here the pages with long musing curled,
And write me new my future&rsquo;s epigraph,
New angel mine, unhoped for in the world!</p>
