<p class="poetry">My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!

And yet they seem alive and quivering
Against my tremulous hands which loose the string
And let them drop down on my knee to-night.
This said,&mdash;he wished to have me in his sight
Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring
To come and touch my hand . . . a simple thing,
Yet I wept for it!&mdash;this, . . . the paper&rsquo;s light . .
.
Said, Dear I love thee; and I sank and quailed
As if God&rsquo;s future thundered on my past.
This said, I am thine&mdash;and so its ink has paled
With lying at my heart that beat too fast.
And this . . . O Love, thy words have ill availed
If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!</p>
