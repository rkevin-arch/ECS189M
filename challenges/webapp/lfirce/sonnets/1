<h4>I</h4>
<p class="poetry">I thought once how Theocritus had sung
Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,
Who each one in a gracious hand appears
To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:
And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,
I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,
The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,
Those of my own life, who by turns had flung
A shadow across me.&nbsp; Straightway I was &rsquo;ware,
So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move
Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;
And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,&mdash;
&ldquo;Guess now who holds
thee!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Death,&rdquo; I said, But, there,
The silver answer rang, &ldquo;Not Death, but Love.&rdquo;</p>
