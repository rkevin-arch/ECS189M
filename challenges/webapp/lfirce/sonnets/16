<p class="poetry">And yet, because thou overcomest so,<br />
Because thou art more noble and like a king,<br />
Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling<br />
Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow<br />
Too close against thine heart henceforth to know<br />
How it shook when alone.&nbsp; Why, conquering<br />
May prove as lordly and complete a thing<br />
In lifting upward, as in crushing low!<br />
And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword<br />
To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,<br />
Even so, Belov&euml;d, I at last record,<br />
Here ends my strife.&nbsp; If thou invite me forth,<br />
I rise above abasement at the word.<br />
Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth!</p>
