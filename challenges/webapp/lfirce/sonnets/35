<h4>XXXV</h4>
<p class="poetry">If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange

And be all to me?&nbsp; Shall I never miss
Home-talk and blessing and the common kiss
That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange,
When I look up, to drop on a new range
Of walls and floors, another home than this?
Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is
Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change
That&rsquo;s hardest.&nbsp; If to conquer love, has tried,
To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove,
For grief indeed is love and grief beside.
Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love.
Yet love me&mdash;wilt thou?&nbsp; Open thy heart wide,
And fold within, the wet wings of thy dove.</p>
