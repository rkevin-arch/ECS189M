Time to actually organize this thing properly and not do everything as root on twinpeaks with zero documentation whatsoever.

What I plan on doing:
  - Organize each challenge into its folder, with a yaml file that contains a description of it, so I can use an automated script to deploy the right challenges to the right places (i.e. binaries to xinetd, web challenges to beamsplitter, downloadable challenges to mellivora)
